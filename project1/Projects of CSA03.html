<h1>Project 1 of CSA03<br>
  </h1>

<hr><br>
  There is no writing exam for CSA03 (Nature Inspired Design).  However, a student
  is required to join in a team that might have 4 members at most. 
Each team is required to finish two projects. "Project 1" assigned today is to apply evolutionary
 algorithms on optimization tasks. "Project 2" assigned next time is to apply evolutionary
 algorithms on learning tasks. You can choose 
 "Project 1" given
as follows. However, it is just an example for Project 1. In Project 1, each team can
freely choose any other optimization tasks by applying a learned evolutionary
algorithm.

<h2>1. Project 1</h2>
  Compare the performance between&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Evolutionary
 Programming (EP) </span>and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fast Evolutionary
 Programming (FEP)</span> on at least 2 multimodal functions. <br>
  <br>
  You could implement <span style="font-weight: bold;">EP</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">FEP </span>based on the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Lectures 2 and 3</span>. The details of the implementations 
of&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">EP</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">FEP </span>can be found in the paper:<br>

  You could also find the test multimodal functions in the given paper. For 
the test functions, you could either use the functions given in the paper 
or choose any other functions not included in the given paper.<br>
  <br>
  The purpose of this project is to let you know how important the search
step  sizes are in evolutionary algorithms, and how to adjust the search
step sizes during the evolutionary process. <b><br>

<h2>2. Project Report</h2>
  Two weeks are given for doing the project. Submit your team project report in PDF by emails (subject as "Project 1 of CSA03") before the deadline. The report
 should include the following parts:<br>
   
<ol>
    <li>descriptions of the algorithms used.</li>
    <li>descriptions of the test problems used;</li>
    <li>descriptions of the simulation results;</li>
    <li>the code used to get the results.<br>
